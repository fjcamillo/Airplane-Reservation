Airplane Seat Reservation App

The Airplane Seat Reservation App is a command line tool for Airport Representatives. The representatives are given options that would specify on what part of the plane the tourist wants to seat.

This app serves as my practice in learning object oriented programming in python while also further deepening my knowledge with the same language
